    <h3>Functioning</h3>

    <p>The Circle of Studies of Idea and Ideology is an institution with the task of investigating the political
        thought and collective organizational practices called for by the return of the communist hypothesis.
    Our task is to think the work of philosophers engaged with the reformulation of the communist Idea – Slavoj Zizek,
        Alain Badiou, Jacques Ranciere and Giorgio Agamben.
    CSII has been in operation since 2012 in Rio de Janeiro and Sao Paulo, Brazil, where it works together with
        Partido Socialismo e Liberdade. And now, it is being implemented here in Montreal, Canada, where we will be
        associated with Quebec Solidaire.
    Every cell of the Circle of Studies of Idea and Ideology (CSII) meets once a week. Below are the time and address
        for Montreal:
    The group will meet every Thursday, from 18h to 21h. All meetings will take place at the Centre Internationaliste
        Ryerson Foundation Aubin (CIRFA), located on 170 rue Saint Viateur, est, Montreal.
    In case of any changes of date, time or location, all participants will be notified by telephone of email, by the
        cell’s secretary.
    Each meeting of CSII is guided by the collective study of a fundamental text, taken from the work of
        Alain Badiou, Slavoj Zizek, Giorgio Agamben or Jacques Ranciere. These texts will also guide our study of
        other authors, under the condition that this study is necessary for the understanding of our fundamental texts.</p>

    <h3>There three fundamental operational principles to CSII</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>
            <p>
                CSII meetings are not lectures, the co-ordinator of the discussion is not a professor – the wager of CSII is that some ideas can only be studied collectively.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                The pace and course of study is determined by the participants and text, without any pre-established scheduled progress – CSII does not hurry, it takes the time needed for understanding.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                Between all meetings every participant must write a work note, for which there is no restriction except that it make reference to the text being studied by the cell – these notes will form the very object of study of the next meeting.
            </p>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        Before each next meeting, the notes must be emailed to csiimontreal@gmail.com, so they can be formulated in time for the next meeting.
        The note is the material mark of our participation in CSII, and is more important than mere presence.
        If a participant failed to contribute a note for four consecutive weeks – or misses four consecutive weeks, on any other condition set out in the CSII Project – his involvement will be terminated.
        For a detailed presentation of the principles that rule the functioning of the Circle of Studies of Idea and Ideology please see our Project – available here.
